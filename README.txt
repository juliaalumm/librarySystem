There are certain things that you couldn’t fix for my coursework like if you want to reenter a data into the entry box you’ll need to stop and rerun the Python file as it won’t work properly just re-entered the database.txt and logfile.txt will be doubled and labels won’t get deleted if you press the button again. So, you can only press the button once in each tab.

Here is the sample data to input (separated by |):
Book Search = the | and there | lolita
Book Checkout = high, 20 | kite, 3 | kit, 22
Book Return = 15 | 21 | 6 | 9
Book Recommend = clai | soph | juli | high | kite
